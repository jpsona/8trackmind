                            Featuring a dynamic male and female vocal team, wicked 3-piece horn section, and super-tight rhythm
                            section, 8Track Mind is an 8-piece pop, rock, and groove band that plays the best in popular dance and
                            party music - the 70s, 80s, and a little bit either side - with the level of professionalism you'd expect to find
                            in Montreal or New York. But this band is from Fredericton, New Brunswick, and they're the only one In
                            eastern Canada with a songlist that includes material by Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Chicago, the
                            Doobie Brothers, Sade, Donna Summer, Lighthouse, Heart, the Bee Gees, and so much more.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Yes, 8Track Mind delivers great music that everyone knows and loves, and it's propelled by enough energy to
                            light up any dance floor. As so many have said and the constant calls for encores confirm, 8Track Mind
                            may very well be the best pop/rock party and dance band east of Montreal.
